    "fix": "The error is caused by the 'Zebra Strip' screen connector coming loose. You can either replace the zebra strip entierly or, sometimes, placing some folded paper or foam behind the strip fixes the issue. You will have to take the back off your watch, but for the Steel especially, it's not particularly intricate job. The OGs come in two varients, 'screw-sealed' and 'glue-sealed'. The glue-sealed versions are much harder to open up.",
